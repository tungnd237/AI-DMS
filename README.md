# Development of a Data Analysis/Management Module for AI Models

This project addresses the challenge of managing and analyzing high-dimensional image data, with a focus on creating embeddings and performing similarity searches. The project repository contains two main parts:

1. **dms-backend**: A backend service built with Django for handling API requests, managing data, and performing machine learning tasks.
2. **dms-fe**: A frontend application built with React.js for user interaction, data visualization, and similarity search.

## Project Overview

The system developed includes:
- A **Compute Engine** that uses machine learning models to compute embeddings from high-dimensional image data.
- An **Interactive Data Visualization Module** using Plotly to allow users to explore complex data in a 3D space.
- A **Similarity Search Feature** enabling efficient image comparison based on embeddings.

## Features

- **High-Dimensional Data Analysis**: Efficient computation of vector embeddings to manage large image datasets.
- **Similarity Search**: Allows users to search for similar images based on precomputed embeddings.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualizations of image clusters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface for easy interaction with the system.

## Installation and Setup

### Backend (dms-backend)

The backend is responsible for managing API requests, handling machine learning tasks, and serving data to the frontend.

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd dms-backend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the database:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

5. The backend server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (dms-fe)

The frontend is responsible for providing a user-friendly interface to upload images, perform similarity searches, and visualize image clusters.

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
    cd dms-fe
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. The frontend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Upload an image via the frontend interface to perform similarity searches.
- Visualize image clusters in 3D based on the embeddings generated by the backend.
- Filter and inspect specific data points for detailed metadata and similarity scores.

## Future Improvements

- Expansion of supported AI models for embedding generation.
- Improved scalability to handle larger datasets.
- Enhanced security and privacy features.
